## What is pubtex?
pubtex is a tool that allows you to convert pubmed IDs in your latex document to bibtex entries. It's primarily based on javascript with almost no server side processing. 

## How to use?
You can access pubtex at **[http://www.pubtex.info/](http://www.pubtex.info/)**. For a demo, hit the example button to load a sample latex document.
